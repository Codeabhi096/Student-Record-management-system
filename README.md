# Student-Record-management-system

A minimalist desktop app for managing student records. Records are saved directly to an Excel file, reducing data entry labor costs and improving efficiency. To run the system locally:

Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).
Write your C++ code and save it with the .cpp extension.
Compile the code using g++ -o output_filename source_file.cpp.
Run the executable using ./output_filename (Linux/Mac) or output_filename.exe (Windows).
